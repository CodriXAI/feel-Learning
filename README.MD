# ❤️ Feel Learning - AI project without Model
>Feel Learning is a sentiment analysis simulation that mimics the behavior of an AI, but without using any pre-trained machine learning models. Instead, it relies purely on logical rules and a custom-built dataset of labeled sentences to determine whether a given sentence is positive, negative, or neutral.

>The system works by comparing input sentences with known examples from the dataset. It uses pattern matching, keyword frequency, and scoring strategies to infer sentiment. While it doesn't involve machine learning or training processes, it demonstrates the foundations of sentiment classification using structured logic and data.

>This project is a simplified approach to understand how an AI might feel or react to different inputs, hence the name Feel Learning — learning to feel through logical reasoning.
